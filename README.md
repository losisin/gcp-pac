GCP Policy as Code (gcp-pac) for your Pulumi typescript apps.

## Installation

```bash
npm install gcp-pac --save-dev
```

## Usage

```bash
pulumi preview --policy-pack ./node_modules/gcp-pac
```

Will output something like this:

```bash
Loading policy packs...

     Type                     Name                  Plan       Info
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack      my-stack             
 ~   ‚îî‚îÄ gcp:cloudrun:Service  default               update     [diff: ~metadata,template]

Policies:
    ‚ö†Ô∏è gcp-pac@v1.0.0 (local: node_modules/gcp-pac)
        - [advisory]  cloudrun-disallow-public-ingress  (gcp:cloudrun/service:Service: default)
          Check that CloudRun services do not have public ingress set to 'all'.
          CloudRun services should not have public ingress set to 'all'. Use a load balancer instead.
```

Override `enforcementLevel` to `mandatory` to fail the preview if the policy is not met. First, create a `json` file for specific ploicies:

```json
{
  "cloudrun-disallow-public-ingress": "mandatory"
}
```

or, for all policies:

```json
{
  "all": "mandatory"
}
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
pulumi preview --policy-pack ./node_modules/gcp-pac --policy-pack-config policy.json
```

which will fail the preview if any policy is not met:

```bash
Loading policy packs...

     Type                     Name                  Plan       Info
     pulumi:pulumi:Stack      my-stack             1 error
 ~   ‚îî‚îÄ gcp:cloudrun:Service  default               update     [diff: ~metadata,template]

Policies:
    ‚ùå gcp-pac@v1.0.0 (local: node_modules/gcp-pac)
        - [mandatory]  cloudrun-disallow-public-ingress  (gcp:cloudrun/service:Service: default)
          Check that CloudRun services do not have public ingress set to 'all'.
          CloudRun services should not have public ingress set to 'all'. Use a load balancer instead.

Diagnostics:
  pulumi:pulumi:Stack (my-stack):
    error: preview failed
```
